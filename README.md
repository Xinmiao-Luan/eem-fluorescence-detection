# eem-fluorescence-detection
Detecting drainage misconnections using fluorescence EEM data. This MATLAB-based project uses the drEEM toolbox with PARAFAC modeling for spectral decomposition and anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy in urban water quality monitoring.

Note: Due to confidentiality agreements, the full city-scale deployment data and code cannot be shared publicly. This repository presents a simplified demo version of the detection analysis using the EEM data.
